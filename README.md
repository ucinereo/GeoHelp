# GeoHelp
A big part of every event is safety. Organizers of these events go to great lengths to ensure the safety of their guests. Security personnel, emergency tents, and paramedics are a crucial part of the safety measures of every event. But how can someone help you if they don't know you need help? To identify a person who needs help in a crowd of 15'000 people is very difficult. Our team connected technology and participation to create resilience.
